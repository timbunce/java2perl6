Revision history for Perl extension Java::Javap.

0.03 Sat Jul 21 08:29:53 CDT 2007
    - Added support for recurse flag at the command line.  It now tries
      to process any types it encounters but doesn't recognize.
    - Improved the grammar to account for more variety.  It's still incomplete.
      Bug reports welcome.
    - Added a lot of POD and expanded the README.

    - Completed initial work on class generation (constructors are missing).
    - Guarded tests so they don't run if you don't have javap in your path.
    - Fixed bug in qualified names, now there is a dot separated java
      name and a double colon separated perl name.
    - Made java2perl6 usable.  Only recursive work remains.
