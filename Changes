Revision history for Perl extension Java::Javap.

0.06 July 10th 2010
    - Added set_types and add_types options.
    - --recurse --nest --check is now the default.
    - Assorted bug fixes.
    - Now handles constructors
    - Now handles 'implements'

0.05 July 2nd 2010
    - Simplified grammar for arg_lists and similar constructs, removed
      middle production which was not needed.
    - Added mkjdbc.pl script that runs java2perl6 on the JDBC classes
      and then runs perl6 on each to validate them.
    - Repository moved to http://github.com/timbunce/java2perl6

0.04 Wed Jul 25 16:47:30 CDT 2007
    - Improved the grammar so java.net.URL can be recursively parsed without
      error.  This included:
        allow $ as a legal character in identifier names
        allowing constants to have array type
        allowing transient, native, and synchronized in various places.
    - Corrected error in recursion.

0.03 Sat Jul 21 08:29:53 CDT 2007
    - Added support for recurse flag at the command line.  It now tries
      to process any types it encounters but doesn't recognize.
    - Improved the grammar to account for more variety.  It's still incomplete.
      Bug reports welcome.
    - Added a lot of POD and expanded the README.

0.02 Wed Jul 18 17:41:38 CDT 2007
    - Completed initial work on class generation (constructors are missing).
    - Guarded tests so they don't run if you don't have javap in your path.
    - Fixed bug in qualified names, now there is a dot separated java
      name and a double colon separated perl name.
    - Made java2perl6 usable.  Only recursive work remains.
