Revision history for Perl extension Java::Javap.

0.02 Wed Jul 18 17:41:38 CDT 2007
    - Completed initial work on class generation (constructors are missing).
    - Guarded tests so they don't run if you don't have javap in your path.
    - Fixed bug in qualified names, now there is a dot separated java
      name and a double colon separated perl name.
    - Made java2perl6 usable.  Only recursive work remains.
